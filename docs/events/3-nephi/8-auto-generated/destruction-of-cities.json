  "name": "Destruction of cities",
  "description": "Multiple cities were destroyed; the city of Moroni sank into the sea, and the earth was carried up upon the city of Moronihah that became a great mountain. There was a great and terrible destruction in both the land southward and the land northward; the whole face of the land was dramatically altered due to tempest, whirlwinds, thunderings, lightnings, and exceedingly great quaking of the earth. Many highways were broken, level roads spoiled, and many smooth places became rough. Great cities were sunk, burned, and shaken until their buildings fell, leaving many places desolate with slain inhabitants.",
