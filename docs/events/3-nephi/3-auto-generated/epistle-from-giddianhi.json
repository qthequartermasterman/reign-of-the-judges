  "description": "Lachoneus, the governor of the land, received an epistle from Giddianhi, the leader of the robbers. Giddianhi demanded the Nephites yield their cities, lands, and possessions to avoid destruction, claiming that his men had an unconquerable spirit and would annihilate the Nephites if they refused. He offered an opportunity for collaboration, insisting they would not be enslaved but would be considered partners instead.",
