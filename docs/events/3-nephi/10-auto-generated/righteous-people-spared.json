  "description": "The more righteous part of the people were saved because they received the prophets and did not shed the blood of the saints. They were spared from being sunk and buried in the earth, drowned in the depths of the sea, burned by fire, crushed to death, carried away in the whirlwind, or overpowered by smoke and darkness.",
