  "name": "Continued Division into Tribes",
  "description": "In the thirty-first year, the people were divided into tribes according to their families, kindreds, and friends. They established a temporary agreement not to go to war against one another and created strict laws to prevent one tribe from trespassing against another. This led to a degree of peace in the land; however, their hearts were turned from the Lord, and they stoned the prophets and cast them out from among them.",
