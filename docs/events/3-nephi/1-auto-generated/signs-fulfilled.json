  "name": "Signs Fulfilled",
  "description": "In the commencement of the ninety and second year, the prophecies began to be fulfilled more fully with greater signs and greater miracles among the people. However, some began to say that the time for the words spoken by Samuel, the Lamanite, had passed. They rejoiced over their brethren, claiming that the time had passed, thus making the faith of the believers seem vain. This led to a great uproar throughout the land, causing the believers to feel sorrowful. In response, they watched steadfastly for the sign that had been foretold, hoping to confirm that their faith was not in vain.",
