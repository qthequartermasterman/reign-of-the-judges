  "name": "Wickedness and Abominations",
  "description": "The people began to forget the signs and wonders they had witnessed, becoming hardened in their hearts and blinded in their minds. They disbelieved in the doctrine of Christ, believing it to be foolish and vain. They waxed strong in wickedness and abominations, not believing that any more signs or wonders would be given. Satan led away the hearts of the people, tempting them to do great wickedness in the land.",
