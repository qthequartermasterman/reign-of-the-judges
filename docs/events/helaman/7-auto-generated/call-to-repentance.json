  "name": "Call to repentance",
  "description": "Nephi calls the people to repentance, questioning how they could have succumbed to the devil's temptations and warning them of the consequences of their iniquity. He admonishes them to turn unto the Lord and explains that their hard hearts have caused the Lord to forsake them, leading to the dire consequences of being scattered and consumed by wild beasts unless they repent.",
