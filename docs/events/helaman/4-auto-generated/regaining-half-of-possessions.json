  "name": "Regaining Half of Possessions",
  "description": "In the sixty-first year of the reign of the judges, Moronihah led his forces to regain half of all Nephite possessions that had been lost to the Lamanites. This loss had come about due to the iniquities, pride, and oppression of the Nephite people. The people, after repenting, began to prosper again under Moronihah's guidance as he preached and prophesied to them.",
