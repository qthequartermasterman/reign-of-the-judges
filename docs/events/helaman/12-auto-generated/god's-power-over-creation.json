  "description": "The chapter illustrates God's great power, specifically how the dust of the earth moves at His command, the hills and mountains tremble and quake, and the earth shakes by the power of His voice. It describes how He can command the earth to move, lengthen the day, dry up waters, or raise up mountains, all demonstrating His supreme authority over nature.",
