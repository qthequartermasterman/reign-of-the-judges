  "description": "The Nephites began to support the Gadianton robbers, particularly the more wicked part of them, which led to their overspreading all the land of the Nephites. This resulted in seducing many of the Nephites, who turned from righteousness and participated in the wicked works, secret murders, and combinations of the Gadianton robbers.",
