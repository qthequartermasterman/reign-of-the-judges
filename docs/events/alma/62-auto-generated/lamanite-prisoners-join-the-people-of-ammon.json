  "description": "Many of the Lamanite prisoners were desirous to join the people of Ammon and were granted their wish. Therefore, all the prisoners of the Lamanites joined the people of Ammon and began to labor in tilling the ground, raising all manner of grain, and flocks and herds of every kind. This relieved the Nephites from a great burden, as they were relieved from all the prisoners of the Lamanites.",
